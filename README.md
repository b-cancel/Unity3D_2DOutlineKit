<h5>
<h4>Note:</h4>
If you absolutely need child parent relationships you can easily add then, simply look for the commit marked "MERGE AND CHILDREN CODE REMOVED".
This Commit has deleted code that can guide you in your implementation. 
I didn't Implement it because there are different ways to make it for different circumstances 
and the solution that covers them all is expensive and would make this asset more complex than it already is.</h5>
<h4>Limitations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The Standard "Reset" Option Does Not Work (use the build in reset button instead)</li>
  <li>The "Copy Component" Option and there the "Paste Component as New" and "Paste Component Values" Dont Work</li>
</ul>
